What are Vite and Create React App (CRA)?

These are React project builders (or “bundlers”) that help you create and run React apps easily.

They are frontend tools, while Express is backend.

Let’s compare them clearly 👇

Feature	Vite ⚡	Create React App (CRA) 🧱
Creator	Made by Evan You (Vue’s creator)	Made by Facebook
Speed	Very fast startup and builds	Slower, older setup
Command to create project	npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react	npx create-react-app my-app
Run command	npm run dev	npm start
Config file	vite.config.js	No config (hidden)
Recommended in 2025?	✅ Yes (modern & fast)	⚠️ Older, rarely used now
🧩 3️⃣ When and why to use each
🟩 Vite (recommended for new React projects)

Use this when:

You’re starting a new React project.

You want fast reloads and modern setup.

You don’t want heavy configurations.

🪄 Example:

npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev


Then open http://localhost:5173

🟦 Create React App (CRA)

Use this when:

You are working on an older tutorial or legacy project.

You need something that already comes with react-scripts.

🪄 Example:

npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
npm start


Then open http://localhost:3000

🧱 4️⃣ How to setup Express + React (Vite) together

Here’s the clean modern setup:

my-project/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── package.json   (Express app)
│   └── server.js
│
└── frontend/
    ├── package.json   (React app)
    └── src/

Step 1: Backend (Express)
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express


Create server.js:

import express from "express";
const app = express();
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello from Express!"));
app.listen(5000, () => console.log("Server running on port 5000"));


Run it:

node server.js

Step 2: Frontend (React with Vite)

From the same my-project folder:

npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Now:

React frontend runs on port 5173

Express backend runs on port 5000

You can later connect them using Axios:

axios.get('http://localhost:5000/')

✅ Summary
Tool	Purpose	Command	Used For
Express	Backend (server/API)	npm init -y && npm install express	Serve data, handle routes
Vite	Frontend (React app builder)	npm create vite@latest myapp -- --template react	Build and run modern React apps
CRA	Frontend (React app builder, older)	npx create-react-app myapp	Older tutorials or compatibility

Open your package.json and look under "dependencies" and "devDependencies".

🔸 If you see this:
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.0.0"
}


or

"dependencies": {
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.0.0"
}


✅ That means your project uses Vite →
You should have this script section:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}


You start it with:

npm run dev

🔹 If you see this:
"dependencies": {
  "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
}


✅ That means your project uses Create React App (CRA) →
You should have:

"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}


You start it with:

npm start

🟨 2️⃣ Check how the project was created

If you used:

npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react


→ It’s Vite.

If you used:

npx create-react-app my-app


→ It’s Create React App (CRA).

🟦 3️⃣ Check your folder structure (optional clue)
Tool	Typical Folder Structure
Vite	Has vite.config.js or vite.config.ts
CRA	Has no vite.config.js, but includes a public/ and src/ folder with a react-scripts dependency
