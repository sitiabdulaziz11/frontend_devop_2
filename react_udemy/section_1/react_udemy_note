React = Declarative UI Programming

With React, you define the target Ul state(s) - not the steps to get there!

Instead, React will figure out & perform the necessary steps

Declarative

Define the goal, not the steps

let content;

if (user.isLoggedIn) { content } else { content <button>Continue</button> <button>Log In</button> }

return content:

JS

Imperative

Define the steps, not the goal

let btn document.querySelector('button');

if (user.isLoggedIn) ( button.textContent 'Continue': } else { } button.textContent Log In':

document.body.append(btn);

Here is a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of Declarative vs Imperative programming in React with clear examples and easy language.

🌟 What Does “React = Declarative UI Programming” Mean?

React uses a Declarative style.

That means:

✔ You tell React WHAT you want the UI to look like
❌ You do not tell React HOW to change the UI step-by-step

React will figure out the steps by itself.

🟦 Declarative Programming (React’s Style)
👉 You describe the final result (the UI output).

You write what the UI should show, depending on the state.

Example:
let content;

if (user.isLoggedIn) {
  content = <button>Continue</button>;
} else {
  content = (
    <>
      <button>Continue</button>
      <button>Log In</button>
    </>
  );
}

return content;

✔ You describe the UI based on state (user.isLoggedIn)
✔ React handles the DOM updates for you
✔ You don't manually select elements or update them

This is easier, cleaner, and less error-prone.

🟥 Imperative Programming (Vanilla JavaScript Style)
👉 You describe every step needed to make the UI happen.

You must manually:

select HTML elements

change text

change styles

insert or remove elements from the DOM

Example:
let btn = document.querySelector('button');

if (user.isLoggedIn) {
  btn.textContent = 'Continue';
} else {
  btn.textContent = 'Log In';
}

document.body.append(btn);

❌ You tell the browser how to update the UI
❌ More code, harder to maintain
❌ You must manually track changes
🌍 A Simple Real-Life Comparison
Declarative (React):

You tell a taxi driver:
👉 “Take me to Addis Ababa Stadium.”
The driver decides the best route.

Imperative (Vanilla JS):

You tell the taxi driver:
👉 “Go straight, turn left, then right, then… etc.”
You must tell every step.

React = Taxi Driver
Vanilla JS = You controlling the car

📌 Summary Table
Feature	Declarative (React)	Imperative (JS)
You describe…	The UI result	Step-by-step instructions
Who manages UI updates?	React	You
Workload	Less	More
Code	Clean	Messy
Example	return <button>Login</button>	button.textContent = 'Login'
💡 Why React Chooses Declarative Style

Because it:

reduces bugs

makes UI predictable

makes code easier to understand

lets React optimize updates behind the scenes

works perfectly with component-based UI

If you want, I can explain with images, diagrams, or show more small examples like:

Declarative vs Imperative for forms

Declarative vs Imperative for lists

Declarative vs Imperative for conditional UI

Is user.isLoggedIn built-in?
❌ No, it is NOT built-in.

This is just an example variable.

You would define it yourself, like:

const user = {
  isLoggedIn: true
};


Or in React real code:

const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

✅ 3. Is textContent built-in?
✔ Yes!

textContent is a built-in DOM property in JavaScript.

It changes the text inside an HTML element.

Example:

button.textContent = 'Continue';


This is imperative — you manually instruct the browser to change the text.

✅ 4. What does document.body.append(btn) do?
✔ It is also a built-in DOM method.

It means:

➡️ Take the HTML element (btn) and add it inside <body> at the end.

Example:

<body>
  <!-- existing content -->
  <button>Continue</button>  <!-- appended -->
</body>


So this:

document.body.append(btn);


inserts a button into the page manually.

This is why we call it "imperative":

You must grab the element

You must change its text

You must insert it into the page

React does ALL of this internally — you just return JSX.

🧠 VERY IMPORTANT SUMMARY
▶ Declarative (React)

You write what you want:

return <button>Continue</button>;


React handles:

creating the button

updating it

inserting it

▶ Imperative (Vanilla JS)

You write every step manually:

let btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.textContent = 'Continue';
document.body.append(btn);

If You Want, I Can Teach You:

✅ How React updates UI without DOM manipulation
✅ Difference between JSX and HTML
✅ More declarative vs imperative examples
✅ Build a simple login UI with state

FIRST: The Data
const content = [
  [
    "React is extremely popular",
    "It makes building complex, interactive UIs a breeze",
    "It's powerful & flexible",
    "It has a very active and versatile ecosystem"
  ],
  [
    "Components, JSX & Props",
    "State",
    "Hooks (e.g., useEffect())",
    "Dynamic rendering"
  ],
  [
    "Official web page (react.dev)",
    "Next.js (Fullstack framework)",
    "React Native (build native mobile apps with React)"
  ]
];

✔ What is content?

It is an array of arrays.

You can think of it as:

content[0] → list for “Why React”

content[1] → list for “Core Features”

content[2] → list for “Resources”

So:

content[0] = ["React is extremely popular", ...]
content[1] = ["Components, JSX & Props", ...]
content[2] = ["Official web page", ...]


This stores the three different tabs' text.

✅ Get Buttons from HTML
const btnWhyReact = document.getElementById("btn-why-react");
const btnCoreFeature = document.getElementById("btn-core-features");
const btnResources = document.getElementById("btn-resources");


These lines:

📌 Look at your HTML
📌 Find elements by their ID
📌 Save them in JavaScript variables

Example:

<button id="btn-why-react">Why React?</button>


The JavaScript finds this button and stores it in the variable.

✅ Get the tab content container
const tabContent = document.getElementById("tab-content");


This finds the HTML element where list items will appear.

Example:

<div id="tab-content"></div>


This is where the <ul><li>...</li></ul> will be placed.

✅ Function: displayContent(items)
function displayContent(items) {
  let listContent = "";

✔ Create a new empty string

This will hold all the <li>...</li> HTML.

for (const item of items) {
  listContent += `<li>${item}</li>`;
}

✔ Loop through the array

If items =
["React is powerful", "React is popular"]

The loop builds:

<li>React is powerful</li>
<li>React is popular</li>

const list = document.createElement("ul");

✔ Create an empty <ul> element

Like writing:

<ul></ul>

tabContent.innerHTML = "";

✔ Clear old content

This removes previous <ul> when you click another button.

list.innerHTML = listContent;

✔ Put the list items inside the <ul>

Now <ul> contains the <li> items.

tabContent.append(list);

✔ Add the finished <ul> to the page

So the user sees the new list.

✅ Function: highlightButton(btn)
btnWhyReact.className = "";
btnCoreFeature.className = "";
btnResources.className = "";

✔ Remove highlight from ALL buttons

Sets their classes to empty (no CSS styles).

btn.className = "active";

✔ Add highlight to the clicked button

active is usually a CSS class in your stylesheet.

✅ Function: handleClick(event)
const btnId = event.target.id;

✔ Get the ID of the clicked button

Example:

If I click button 1 → btn-why-react

If I click button 2 → btn-core-features

highlightButton(event.target);

✔ Highlight the button that was clicked
if (btnId === "btn-why-react") {
  displayContent(content[0]);
} else if (btnId === "btn-core-features") {
  displayContent(content[1]);
} else {
  displayContent(content[2]);
}

✔ Check which button was clicked

Depending on button ID:

show content[0]

or content[1]

or content[2]

This changes the list items dynamically.

✅ Show initial content
displayContent(content[0]);


When the page loads, show the first tab.

✅ Add event listeners
btnWhyReact.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
btnCoreFeature.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
btnResources.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

✔ When a button is clicked

Run handleClick()
Which will:

highlight button

change the list

🎉 Summary: What this code does

When you click each button:

highlight that button

remove highlight from other buttons

change the content list in the tab

show the correct topics

update <ul> dynamically

This is pure vanilla JS, not React.

✅ Draw a diagram
✅ Rewrite it in simpler code
✅ Rewrite it in React (Declarative style)

What This Code Is & Why It’s Used

This is the main entry point of a React application created with React 18 (or newer).
It is responsible for:

✔️ Connecting your React app to the HTML page
✔️ Rendering your <App /> component
✔️ Enabling React’s developer tools like warnings, detecting issues, etc.

📌 Line-by-Line Explanation
1. Import StrictMode from React
import { StrictMode } from "react";


🔍 What it is:
StrictMode is a helper component from React.

🔍 Why it is used:
It helps you find potential problems in your code.
It does NOT run in production (only during development).

StrictMode warns about:

Unsafe lifecycle methods

Deprecated APIs

Unexpected side effects

Code that may break in future updates

It’s React’s way of saying:

“Let me help you write clean and safe React code.”

2. Import createRoot from ReactDOM
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";


🔍 What:
createRoot is the new React 18 method used to render the app.

🔍 Why:
React replaced ReactDOM.render() with this.
It allows:

Concurrent features (better UI updates)

Better performance

3. Import the App component
import App from "./App";


This is your main React component — the main UI of your app.

4. Find the root HTML element
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");


Your index.html usually contains:

<div id="root"></div>


This is the place where your entire React app will appear.

5. Create the React root
const root = createRoot(rootElement);


This prepares React to render your app inside #root.

6. Render your App inside StrictMode
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);


This means:

Render <App />

Wrap it with <StrictMode> so React can warn you about problems.

🧠 Summary (Very Simple)
Code	Meaning
StrictMode	Helps catch errors & warnings during development
createRoot()	New React 18 method to render apps
root.render()	Tells React to show your app on the webpage
<App />	The main component of your React UI
🎯 Why it's important

Because this code:

Starts your whole React app

Connects React to your HTML

Helps you write better code

Follows React 18 best practices
