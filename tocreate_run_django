You already have your model, serializer, viewset, and URLs set up. Now, to run and see your Django REST Framework (DRF) API, you need to follow these steps carefully:

1️⃣ Make sure your app is in INSTALLED_APPS

In your settings.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'your_app_name',  # replace with the actual app name
]

2️⃣ Include your router URLs in the main urls.py

If your current urls.py with the router is inside the app folder, you need to include it in the project-level urls.py:

project/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('your_app_name.urls')),  # Include your app's URLs
]


Now, your API endpoint will start with /api/.

3️⃣ Make migrations and migrate

Run these commands in your terminal to create the database table for your model:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

4️⃣ Create a superuser (optional, for admin access)
python manage.py createsuperuser

5️⃣ Run the development server
python manage.py runserver

6️⃣ Test your API

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/students/


You should see a DRF web interface for your Student model.

You can GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE students from here.

✅ Optional Tip: If you want your URLs to include a trailing slash, make sure DEFAULT_SLASHES = True in settings, but by default DRF handles it.
