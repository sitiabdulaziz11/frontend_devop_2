What does fetch() actually download?

When you call:

const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");


response is NOT the JSON data yet

Instead, it’s a Response object — a container for the raw HTTP response that includes:

Property	What it contains
response.status	HTTP status code (200, 404, etc.)
response.headers	All headers from the server
response.ok	true if status is 200–299
response.text()	Method to get body as plain text
response.json()	Method to parse body as JSON

✅ So what is downloaded?
The entire HTTP response from the server — headers + body.
You still need response.json() (or response.text()) to convert the body into actual data you can use.

🔹 Analogy to Python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
print(response)         # <Response [200]>  -> the container, not the data
print(response.text)    # raw text
print(response.json())  # actual data as Python objects
