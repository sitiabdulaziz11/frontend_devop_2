⚙️ Microservices / Architecture

You might be asked conceptually:

What is a microservice?

How do you make services communicate (e.g., APIs)?

Why microservices are better than monoliths?

💬 3. Prepare for Behavioral (Soft Skill) Questions

They also value communication and teamwork. Expect questions like:

“Tell us about a project you built with Python/Django.”

“What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?”

“How do you handle working in a team?”

“Describe a time when you found and fixed a difficult bug.”

✅ Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to answer.

🧾 4. Prepare to Discuss Your Projects

You have great portfolio projects (like LearningBridge). Be ready to explain:

The goal of the project

Technologies used (Python, Django, MySQL, React, etc.)

⚙️ What is a Microservice?

A microservice is a small, independent, and loosely coupled service that performs a specific business function within a larger system.
Each microservice:

Has its own database (or data layer)

Runs independently

Communicates with others via APIs (often REST or gRPC)

Can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately

✅ Example:
In an e-commerce app, you might have:

User Service → manages users

Order Service → handles orders

Payment Service → processes payments

Each works on its own but together form the full system.

💬 How Do Services Communicate?

Microservices communicate through APIs or message brokers:

Synchronous communication (direct)

Uses REST APIs or gRPC

Real-time response

Example: Order service calls Payment service API

Asynchronous communication (indirect)

Uses message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)

Services send events/messages that others consume later

Improves decoupling and performance

⚖️ Why Microservices Are Better Than Monoliths
Aspect	Monolithic Architecture	Microservices Architecture
Structure	One big codebase	Many small, independent services
Deployment	Must redeploy entire app	Deploy each service separately
Scalability	Scale whole app	Scale specific services only
Technology	Usually one stack	Different stacks per service possible
Fault tolerance	One failure can crash the system	Failure isolated to one service
Development	Hard for large teams	Teams can work independently

✅ In short:
Microservices = modular, scalable, and maintainable.
Monolith = simpler to start, but harder to grow and maintain at scale.

🌟 What is the STAR Method?

The STAR method is a simple structure to answer behavioral questions in a clear and confident way.

It stands for:

Letter	Meaning	What You Explain
S	Situation	Describe the context — when and where it happened
T	Task	Explain what your role or responsibility was
A	Action	Describe the steps you took to solve the problem or complete the task
R	Result	Share the outcome — what happened, what you learned, or improved
💬 Example Question: “How do you handle working in a team?”

Here’s how to answer it using STAR 👇

S – Situation:
During my software engineering program, I worked in a small team to build a student management system using Python (Flask/Django) and React.

T – Task:
My responsibility was to handle the backend API for managing student data and to collaborate with teammates working on the frontend.

A – Action:
I made sure we communicated regularly using tools like GitHub and Slack.
I wrote clear API documentation so the frontend team could easily test endpoints.
When merge conflicts happened, I helped resolve them calmly and explained changes during our stand-up meetings.

R – Result:
Our project was completed successfully and presented on time.
The clear communication and teamwork reduced errors and helped everyone understand the full system better.
It also improved my collaboration and problem-solving skills.

✅ Tips:

Keep your answer positive and specific.

Show communication, collaboration, and accountability.

Avoid saying “I prefer working alone” — even if true, emphasize teamwork value.

Write a Python function to manipulate data
Example 1: Sum a list of numbers
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

# Example use
print(sum_numbers([2, 4, 6]))  # Output: 12

Example 2: Reverse a string
def reverse_string(text):
    return text[::-1]

# Example use
print(reverse_string("Django"))  # Output: ognajD


✅ Explanation:

[::-1] slices the string backward.

sum() is a built-in Python function that adds numbers in a list.

🌐 2️⃣ Build a simple Django API endpoint

Let’s make a small Django REST Framework API that returns a list of students.

Step 1: Create a view (views.py)
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET'])
def get_students(request):
    students = [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Siti", "grade": "A"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Abdul", "grade": "B"},
    ]
    return Response(students)

Step 2: Add the URL (urls.py)
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('students/', views.get_students, name='get_students'),
]


✅ Now:
Run the server → python manage.py runserver
Visit → http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/
You’ll see JSON output like:

[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Siti", "grade": "A"},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Abdul", "grade": "B"}
]

🧮 3️⃣ Query a database using SQL

Here’s a simple example using plain SQL:

SELECT name, age
FROM students
WHERE grade = 'A'
ORDER BY age DESC;


✅ Explanation:

SELECT → choose columns

FROM → table name

WHERE → filter condition

ORDER BY → sort results

In Django ORM, this is equivalent to:

Student.objects.filter(grade='A').order_by('-age')

🪲 4️⃣ Debug a short piece of code

Here’s a broken Python code example 👇

def multiply(a, b)
    result = a * b
    print(result)


❌ Error: Missing colon (:) after function definition.

✅ Fixed version:

def multiply(a, b):
    result = a * b
    print(result)

✅ Bonus: Debugging Tips

Read error messages carefully (they tell you the line number and type of error).

Use print() or pdb to trace variable values.

Check for:

Missing colons :

Wrong indentation

Wrong variable names

Type errors 
(e.g., string + int)

The meaning of text[::-1]

This is called slicing in Python.
The general slice syntax is:

sequence[start:stop:step]

Part	Meaning	Example
start	Where to begin	text[1:] → from index 1 onward
stop	Where to stop (exclusive)	text[:4] → up to index 3
step	How much to move each time	text[::2] → every 2nd character
🔁 Now, [::-1] means:

Start: not specified → start from the end

Stop: not specified → go all the way to the start

Step: -1 → move backwards (reverse order)

✅ Example:

text = "Django"
print(text[::-1])


🧠 Process:

Original: D  j  a  n  g  o
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  5


With [::-1] → output becomes "ognajD"

✨ More slice examples
Code	Output	Explanation
text[::1]	Django	normal order
text[::-1]	ognajD	reversed
text[::2]	Dno	every 2nd letter
text[1::2]	jag	start from index 1, every 2nd letter

When they ask:

“Do you have any questions for us?”

Even if everything was explained, never just say “No.”
It can sound like you’re not curious or engaged.
Instead, ask 1–2 polite, thoughtful questions.

Here are some great examples 👇

💡 Option 1 – About the role

“Could you tell me more about what a typical day or week looks like in this role?”

✅ Shows interest in the job itself.

💡 Option 2 – About growth

“What opportunities are there for learning or professional growth within your team?”

✅ Shows you’re eager to improve and stay long-term.

💡 Option 3 – About the team

“Can you tell me a bit about the team I’d be working with?”

✅ Shows teamwork and curiosity.

💡 Option 4 – About next steps

“What are the next steps in the hiring process?”

✅ Shows confidence and organization.

💡 Option 5 – If you really feel everything was answered

You can still say something positive like:

“Thank you, you’ve explained everything very clearly. I don’t have any other questions right now, but I’m very interested in this opportunity.”

✅ Sounds much more polite and confident than just “No.”

🌟 In short

When they ask “Do you have any questions for us?”, you can say something like:

“Yes, thank you. I’d love to know a bit more about the team culture and the next steps after this interview.”

That leaves a friendly, professional final impression — the interviewer will remember that you cared.
