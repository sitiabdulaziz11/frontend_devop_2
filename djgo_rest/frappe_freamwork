Here’s a step-by-step roadmap for a Flask/Django developer to transition to Frappe/ERPNext. I’ve broken it down into clear phases so you can see what’s similar, what’s new, and how to learn efficiently.

Phase 1: Core Python & Web Fundamentals (Already Covered)

Skills you already know from Flask/Django:

Python programming (functions, classes, modules)

Web development basics: HTTP, requests/responses

Templating (Jinja2/Django templates)

ORM/database concepts (models, queries)

REST APIs and routing

Benefit: You don’t need to start from scratch. Python, web, and ORM knowledge directly transfer.

Phase 2: Understanding Frappe Basics

What to learn:

Frappe Framework Overview

Architecture: backend, frontend, and database layers

DocTypes → similar to Django models, but include permissions, workflows, and metadata

How Frappe apps are structured (apps/, modules/, doctype/, www/)

CLI Commands

bench new-app, bench new-site, bench start, bench migrate

Similar to Django manage.py, but specific to Frappe

Frappe ORM

CRUD operations using frappe.get_doc, frappe.db.get_value, etc.

Linking DocTypes (ForeignKey-like relationships)

Validation and hooks

Phase 3: Frontend & UI in Frappe

What to learn:

Frappe Web Templates (like Jinja2, but with Frappe context)

Forms, reports, and dashboards

Custom scripts (client-side JS) for dynamic behavior

Role-based permissions and field-level control

Tip: If you know Django templates and JS, this part is easier.

Phase 4: ERPNext Modules & Business Logic

What to learn:

How ERPNext modules work:

Accounting, Sales, Purchase, Inventory, HR, Projects, Manufacturing

Workflow, approvals, and role-based access

Customizing modules with custom DocTypes or scripts

ERP concepts: invoices, stock, ledgers, employees, payroll

Tip: This is where the biggest gap lies. Flask/Django won’t teach ERP concepts.

Phase 5: Integrations & Advanced Features

REST API usage in Frappe

Hooks, scheduled tasks, and background jobs

Custom reports and print formats

Deployment: Bench on server, cloud hosting

Phase 6: Practice & Real Projects

Create a simple Frappe app:

Example: Inventory management system

Use DocTypes, forms, and custom scripts

Customize ERPNext module:

Example: Add a field to the Sales Invoice, automate calculations

Build a small full-stack ERP feature end-to-end:

Backend logic → DocType → API → Dashboard display

Summary: Skill Transfer
Skill from Flask/Django	Transfer to Frappe?	Notes
Python programming	✅	Directly transferable
ORM concepts	✅	Frappe DocTypes work similarly
REST APIs	✅	Frappe has built-in REST API support
Templates / HTML / CSS	✅	Learn Frappe templating & JS for dynamic forms
Business logic	⚠️	Need to learn ERP concepts & Frappe workflow
Deployment	⚠️	Frappe uses Bench CLI; different from Django server

💡 Bottom line:
A Flask/Django developer can definitely work with Frappe, but the main learning curve is:

ERP/business domain knowledge

Frappe’s DocType system, workflows, and permissions

Customizing ERPNext modules

If you want, I can also make a 1-month learning plan specifically for a Flask/Django developer to become proficient in Frappe/ERPNext. This will give you a timeline and milestones.

Do you want me to make that plan?
